Branching :-
-----------
Generally a repository can be divided into two factors namely 1)Master 
and 2)Branching

where master is origin.

Assume if you forked a repository then you thought to make changes to a 
file, If you make a direct change or modification to that file, If the 
file consits of any mistakes i.e modification of original file that 
would make mess.

So think you have branched the code and modified, If the modified code 
works perfect then you can merge the branch to master.

case 1) If the branch file is not a forked one then you can directly 
        added to master because your the root(Primary) user of your 
        account.

case 2)If it is a forked file, First you should merge the branch into 
	master in your account it only modifies the change in your 
        account. If you give a pull request to the user from whom you 
	forked then the request is send to him and if he thinks that it 
	is correct then he allows your branch to merge in his master. 
 	Then permanent chages takes place.
